## Bonus Features

### Unit Tests

I developed the app using a TDD (test-driven development) approach, and as such I have written tests alongside the features I have implemented. You can also see test results by viewing the CircleCI logs [here](https://circleci.com/gh/Coteh/logistics).

## Incomplete Bonuses

### Driver Task Recommendation

I initially planned to implement a service for recommending a new time for a task in the case of a conflict, but I ran out of time.

### Role-based views

Role-based functionality has been added to the domain logic, but due to time constraints I did not implement driver-specific views. The interface can only be viewable as the dispatcher currently.
